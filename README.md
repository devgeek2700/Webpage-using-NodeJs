# Weather Webpage Using NodeJs

I have created a Weather website using the backend framework of Node.js and Express.js. This is random website I have created during learning backend framework Node.js and Express.js.
In this project, I have learn how frontend and backend is integrated in a website.

I was able to harness its asynchronous and event-driven nature, allowing for efficient and responsive handling of requests. Express.js provided me with a flexible and minimalist framework to structure my application, making routing and middleware implementation a breeze.

This project has not only strengthened my understanding of backend development but also help me design webiste in more better way.
